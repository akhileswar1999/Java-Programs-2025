    2.Unary Operators
    3.Assignment Operator
    4.Relational Operators
    5.Logical Operators
    6.Ternary Operator
    7.Bitwise Operators
//Arithmetic Operators
    * : Multiplication
    / : Division
    % : Modulo
    + : Addition
    – : Subtraction
    Code:
        int a = 10;
        int b = 3; 
        System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b));
        System.out.println("a % b = " + (a % b));
//Unary Operators
    Unary Operators need only one operand. 
    ++ , Increments by 1.
        Post-Increment: Uses value first, then increments.
        Pre-Increment: Increments first, then uses value.
    -- , Decrements by 1.
        Post-Decrement: Uses value first, then decrements.
        Pre-Decrement: Decrements first, then uses value.
    Code:  
        int a = 10;
        int b = 10;
        // Using unary operators
        System.out.println("Postincrement : " + (a++));
        System.out.println("Preincrement : " + (++a));

    System.out.println("Postdecrement : " + (b--));
    System.out.println("Predecrement : " + (--b));
//Assignment Operator
        += , Add and assign.
        -= , Subtract and assign.
        *= , Multiply and assign.
        /= , Divide and assign.
        %= , Modulo and assign.
    Code:
        int f=1;
        System.out.println("f += 3: " + (f += 3));
        System.out.println("f -= 2: " + (f -= 2));
        System.out.println("f *= 4: " + (f *= 4));
        System.out.println("f /= 3: " + (f /= 3));
//Relational Operators
        == , Equal to.
        != , Not equal to.
        < , Less than.
        <= , Less than or equal to.
        > , Greater than.
        >= , Greater than or equal to.
    Code:
        int a = 10;
        int b = 3;
        int c = 5;

        System.out.println("a > b: " + (a > b));
        System.out.println("a < b: " + (a < b));
        System.out.println("a >= b: " + (a >= b));
        System.out.println("a <= b: " + (a <= b));
        System.out.println("a == c: " + (a == c));
        System.out.println("a != c: " + (a != c));
//Logical Operators
    &&, Logical AND: returns true when both conditions are true.
    ||, Logical OR: returns true if at least one condition is true.
    !, Logical NOT: returns true when a condition is false and vice-versa
    Code:
        boolean x = true;
        boolean y = false;
        System.out.println("x && y: " + (x && y));
        System.out.println("x || y: " + (x || y));
        System.out.println("!x: " + (!x));
//Ternary operator
    The Ternary Operator is a shorthand version of the if-else statement. It has three operands and hence the name Ternary. The general format is ,
                condition ? if true : if false 
    if the condition evaluates to true, then execute the statements after the ‘?’ else execute the statements after the ‘:’. 
        int n1 = 5, n2 = 10, max;
        System.out.println("First num: " + n1);
        System.out.println("Second num: " + n2);
        // Largest among n1 and n2
        max = (n1 > n2) ? n1 : n2;
        // Print the largest number
        System.out.println("Maximum is = " + max);
